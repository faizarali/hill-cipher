Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the
procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through
recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure
and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of
rules, while the running of a procedure involves actually following the rules
and performing the steps.
